# [GameCenter](https://gamecenter-6757f.firebaseapp.com)

A website for friends to play multiplayer games on. Designed with flexibility in mind backend to frontend so I can quickly and easily add new games whenever I might want to. No relation to the similarly named apple service.

# Games

## Chess
Its Chess, for two players! Play one side of the board and try to beat your opponent.

## CrashCoin
My take on the "crash" genre of games. Place bets against a multiplier and try to cash out before it "crashes". No real money involved with this implementation.

## Blackjack
Play against the dealer, and reach a hand value of as close to 21 as possible. Don't go over! Still a WIP.
